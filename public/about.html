            Valentine (the artist and author) is an artist living in the
            American Midwest with his husband, dog, and (married) cats. When not
            making this comic, working at [day job] as a software developer, or
            studying for a Masters' degree (augh!), Valentine likes reading,
            baking, and taking extremely long walks.

              I use geno7's code (or my own twisted version) anywhere I
              independently post comics online. This is a terrific resource for
              anyone making comics on their own HTML websites.

                >Eggramen's Webcomic 2.0 template</a
              >, which was an enormous inspiration for how to design this
              website. This website is the same basic layout, but is very
              different under the hood (I'm using CSS grids, I don't think
              EggRamen's template does).
